How to run the program:

1) At the bottom of the code, there is a section titled “Code Compiler” which has two main print 
statements (Encryption and Decryption).

2) Both encryption and decryption take in 3 arguments:
a. Plain text for encryption/ cipher text for decryption
b. Key
c. CBC mode

3) Input the plain text/cipher text and the key as a single string respectively.

4) Do not change the variable assigned to the CBC mode in the print statement (in my code that 
will be entitled as CBC_encryption and CBC_decryption).

5) Instead modify the Boolean value in CBC flags marked under the Code Compiler.
CBC_encryption = True
CBC_decryption = True

6) The encrypted/decrypted value will be computed for you.
